    <h1>Privacy Policy for Cambridge Dictionary Pop-up</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: September 23, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Cambridge Dictionary Pop-up (the "Extension") handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a clear understanding of how our Extension works.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Cambridge Dictionary Pop-up extension is designed with your privacy in mind. We only collect the minimum information necessary to provide our service. The data we handle is limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Selected Text:</strong> When you select a word or phrase on a webpage, that text is captured by the Extension to fetch its definition.</li>
        <li><strong>Search History (Session-Only):</strong> The Extension keeps a temporary history of the words you have looked up. This history is stored only for the current session and is deleted when you close the pop-up or navigate to a new page.</li>
        <li><strong>Cached Definitions (Session-Only):</strong> To improve performance, the Extension temporarily caches the definitions you have viewed. This cache is also session-only and is cleared when the pop-up is closed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).</strong> The Extension does not track your browsing history, your identity, or any other personal data.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>The data collected is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide Definitions:</strong> The selected text is sent to the Cambridge Dictionary website (<code>dictionary.cambridge.org</code>) to retrieve the corresponding definition. The Extension does not add any personal information to this request.</li>
        <li><strong>To Enable Features:</strong> The session-only history and cache are used to provide features like back/forward navigation and faster loading of previously viewed definitions within the pop-up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your information to outside parties. The only external service the Extension communicates with is the Cambridge Dictionary to fetch definitions. We do not share any data with any other third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data handled by the Extension, including your search history and cached definitions, is stored temporarily on your local machine. This data is not persisted and is automatically deleted at the end of each session. We use <code>DOMPurify</code> to sanitize the content received from the Cambridge Dictionary to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to open an issue on our GitHub repository.</p>
